# About this Wiki

After seeing [Nikita Voloboev](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/)'s [GitBook](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) and [other people who have public a knowledge repository](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge#repositories) I was inspired to start my own.

## How it's Built

This wiki is built using [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).
