## Libraries

-   [Pipe Dream](https://github.com/pipe-dream/laravel) - Create new web projects really fast. By giving Pipe Dream a minimum of input in form of a sketch/entity list it will predict your application schema and feed it into a set of pipes. These pipes will generate all the files needed to get started really quick. - [:package:](https://packagist.org/packages/pipe-dream/laravel "Pipe Dream on Packagist")
