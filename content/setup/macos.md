## Development

-   [Tower][1] - a GUI Git client for one I get annoyed with the command line.

## Productivity

-   [Bear][2] - for quick note tacking and task lists.
-   [DEVONThink Pro Office][3] - for reading, storing, and indexing PDFs and other documents in macOS.

## Social

-   [TweetBot][4] - my favourite Twitter client for iOS and macOS.
